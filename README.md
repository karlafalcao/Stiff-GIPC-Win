# Unified GPU IPC Framework


DESCRIPTION
===========

This repository contains the source code for StiffGIPC, a Unified GPU Incremental Potential Contact Framework introduced in our paper: [StiffGIPC: Advancing GPU IPC for Stiff Affine-Deformable Simulation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3735126) **ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2025**. Our framework consistently achieves high performance in soft, stiff, and hybrid simulations (cloth, elastic solids, rigid bodies, and their hybrid couplings), even when handling high-resolution models, large deformations, and high-speed impacts.

### linux

We use CMake to build the project.

```bash
sudo apt install libglew-dev freeglut3-dev libeigen3-dev nlohmann-json3-dev
```


### Windows && linux
We use [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to manage the libraries we need and use CMake to build the project. The simplest way to let CMake detect vcpkg is to set the system environment variable `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` to `(YOUR_VCPKG_PARENT_FOLDER)/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`

```shell
vcpkg install eigen3:x64-windows freeglut:x64-windows glew:x64-windows nlohmann-json:x64-windows tbb:x64-windows
```

**Note:** 
- ⚠️ The original command was missing `tbb` (required dependency)
- ⚠️ The original command had `freeglut` listed twice
- ✅ Use the corrected command above with proper triplets (`:x64-windows`)

## Building

**For detailed build instructions, see [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md)**

**Quick start:** See [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md) for essential build commands.

**Having issues?** See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for detailed troubleshooting help.

**Recommended CUDA version:** 12.4 ✅ (tested and working)
